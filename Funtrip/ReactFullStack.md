# Basic flow of a modern React full stack project

---

## 1. **Start the Backend and Frontend**

- **Backend server** (Node.js/Express) runs and listens for requests (e.g., on port 3001).
- **Frontend client** (React) runs separately (e.g., on port 3000).

---

## 2. **User Interacts with the Frontend**

- User performs actions in the browser (login, search for a song, etc.).
- These actions trigger functions in React components.

---

## 3. **Frontend Sends Requests**

- The frontend uses libraries like `axios` or `fetch` to send HTTP requests (GET, POST, etc.) to:
  - **Your backend server** (for app-specific logic, database, etc.)
  - **Third-party APIs** (like Spotify, YouTube, etc.)

---

## 4. **Backend Processes the Request**

- The backend receives the request, does the necessary work (e.g., checks login, searches for a song, talks to third-party APIs), and sends a response back to the frontend.

---

## 5. **Frontend Receives the Response**

- The frontend gets the response (data) from the backend.
- It uses **`useState`** to update the relevant state variables with the new data.
- If you need to run code when data changes or when the component loads, you use **`useEffect`**.

---

## 6. **React Re-renders the UI**

- When state changes (via `useState`), React automatically re-renders the component to show the new data.
- The user sees the updated UI (e.g., search results, login status, etc.).

---

## 7. **Repeat as Needed**

- The cycle repeats for every user action that needs to communicate with the backend or third-party services.

---

## Summary

- **Frontend**: Handles user interaction, displays UI, sends requests, updates state/UI.
- **Backend**: Handles business logic, data storage, third-party API calls, returns data.
- **React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)**: Manage and react to data changes in the UI.
- In React, hooks let you "hook into" (connect to) React’s features (like state, lifecycle). You are not creating state or lifecycle from scratch. You are hooking into React’s existing system, so your component can use those features.
